# renderer.mk — the renderer battery entry.
#
# Lives at the protogen root, beside renderer/ (the interpreter tree:
# wasm.mk + lv_conf.h + src/ + lvgl/ + generated/ + assets/ +
# wasm_harness/ + coverage_matrix/ + tools/ + edn/screens/).
# Invoke from the protogen root: `make -f renderer.mk check-renderer`.
#
# Provenance: every recipe here is adapted from the private source repo's
# battery (its harness-test / morph-parity / matrix-gate / demo-parity
# targets and its wasm build targets), with two deliberate deltas:
#   - the source repo's gate-cache wrapping is STRIPPED (a ratified
#     home-move decision: the battery runs UNCACHED first — protogen's push
#     cadence is low; port a gate-cache mechanism only on demonstrated pain);
#   - the container-exec proxy is gone — this file assumes it already
#     runs inside the toolchain container (locally: docker exec into it; in
#     CI: the Dockerfile.base image), the same posture as protogen's other
#     Make targets.
#
# Honesty ledger — what the battery consumes, and from where:
#   - `wasm` / `reference` are fully self-contained: wasm.mk + the vendored
#     lvgl/ + generated/ nanopb projections are all in renderer/.
#   - `fixtures` is the devcards corpus build+judge: tools/devcards' ONE CLI
#     against the freshly-built renderer/output/controls.wasm, with the ui
#     bindings compiled from the checkout's OWN output/java
#     (tools/devcards/tools/compile-bindings.sh, alias :bindings).
#   - The harness/oracle fixture generators (visual-regression scenes, morph
#     triples, the matrix/demo EDN→pb codegen) run from tools/renderer-gen —
#     the INTERIM fixture source relocated from the private source repo,
#     with its own deps.edn and target/proto-classes
#     (tools/compile-protos.sh). The ratified design still converges the
#     fixture source onto tools/devcards' public UiAst builder; when that
#     emitter lands it replaces these aliases — one fixture source for
#     oracles AND devcards.
#   - coverage_matrix/run.sh and tools/demo-parity.sh are ROOT-ANCHORED
#     drivers: WS derives from the renderer tree root, codegen runs via
#     `rgen` in tools/renderer-gen, and tools/in-container.sh fails loud
#     outside a container.
